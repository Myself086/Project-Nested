Dev build:
- Fixed CHR pattern swapping for mapper 4 (again)
- Fixed indirect JMP list initial upper bound, was likely to crash games using non-native return address
- Fixed noise channel from not playing for some games
- Fixed triangle volume from going quiet sometimes
- Added more triangle samples for supporting higher frequencies
- Fixed an error when attempting to import SRM feedback to an unsaved profile
- Optimized IO emulation with the new inline script
- Fixed a memory leak when recompiling unconditional branches
- Fixed recompiling branch pointing inside another opcode's operand which was often causing games to reset
- Fixed JSR to RAM while using non-native return address
- Added auto resize to Array module
- Added direct indexed access for mapper 4 registers
- Fixed CPU reading CHR ROM when patterns are swapped by the mapper
- Fixed "Bad call" error when destination is in RAM
- Fixed SPC code address range, also prevents triangle table from being wiped shortly after power-on
- Fixed vertical scroll value being off by 1
- Added more opcodes to the interpreter (but not complete)
- Fixed ExHiROM for snes9x
- Fixed graphical issues when nametable mirror changes
- Fixed reading mappers 17-255
- Added support for 256kb SRAM, mostly used as extra WRAM

v1.3
- Added support for read-modify-write to IO ports
- Port $2000 is now thread safe, fixes Final Fantasy I random crashes
- Fixed AOT JMP across banks
- Fixed branch destinations to $7f0000, commonly used by AOT and once by JIT
- Fixed ExHiROM for SD2SNES
- Added option to truncate ROM size instead of a power of 2
- Fixed minor math error on the performance display
- Added indirect IO access
- Fixed a crash that sometimes happened after exiting a NES IRQ
- Fixed memory emulation assumptions after executing an idle loop
- Fixed some errors during the final stage of generating a SNES file
- Fixed stack depth assumption when disassembling
- Added load/compare absolute for idle loop detection
- Fixed mapper 1 single screen lower bank (upper bank untested)
- Fixed memory emulation for indirect JMP in range $6000-$ffff
- Removed unfinished IRQ mask emulation
- Removed old interpreted RTS
- Added options to define ROM ranges as being static
- Fixed pulse and noise halt bit
- Added opcode $42 to patch forcing native return
- Added inline capability to IO port emulation
- Fixed palette mirrors
- Added the ability to patch timed scroll changes
- Added option to support illegal NOP opcodes
- Fixed a memory leak when RTS is interpreted (non-native return address)

v1.2
- Fixed JMP to WRAM
- Added indirect JMP executed from WRAM
- Minor performance improvement when indirect load/store changes bank
- Minor performance improvement to CPU side of sound emulation
- Large performance improvement to indirect JMP
- Added page wrap support to indirect JMP
- Added option to recompile code in PRG RAM
- Fixed indirect JMP into interpreted RAM
- Added some options to disable stack optimizations
- Fixed loading/saving unknown settings in a profile

v1.1
- Fixed sprite pattern table swap made by mappers when sprites are 8x16 in size.
- Fixed sprite transfer from pages $08-$1f and $60-$ff
- VramQ is now optionally resizable
- Fixed CHR pattern swapping for mapper 4
- Added nametable mirror select for mapper 4
- Partly fixed nametable mirror select for mapper 1
- Fixed STX/STY to $2000 and $4014
- Sprite size and pattern table are now decided at the beginning of each frame rather than during transfer
- Fixed RTS used as indirect jump
- Fixed pushing constant return address with PHA
- Fixed indirect JMP reading from pages $08-$1f and $60-$ff
- Added blue screen of death
- Fixed black screen on repro carts (thanks to soniccd123)
- Fixed compatibility with Mesen-S
- Added ; as a line separator when editing patches
- Added a reset code to the SPC, necessary for combo randomizers (write $F5 to port $2140)
