# Project-Nested

Project Nested is a NES emulator running on the raw power of the SNES. Inspired by the SNES originally designed to be backward compatible and wanting to code a JIT compiler. This project was started in the summer of 2018 after 3 casual years (2015-2018) doing math on its potential performance until the day the design was in theory capable of running games at full speed.

Emulators are software capable of executing code normally incompatible to the current hardware. They often come at a big performance loss due to hardware differences and CPU code running indirectly. High performance emulators will rewrite code JIT (just-in-time) as opposed to AOT (ahead-of-time) due to unpredictable code destinations.

If you have legally owned ROM dump of NES games, they may be playable on SNES by using Project Nested and a flash cart (SD2SNES, Super Everdrive, etc).
